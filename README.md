Great 🚀 Here’s a **complete `README.md`** you can use for your **DevSecOps GitHub Actions Project**.

I’ve made it **professional, well-structured, and beginner-friendly**, with **step-by-step explanations** of each workflow stage.

# DevSecOps Project with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**.  
The pipeline integrates **security, automation, and deployment best practices** by ensuring that every change is automatically tested, scanned, and securely deployed.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality Checks** (Linting)
- **Unit Tests** for application reliability
- **Security Scanning** with:
  - [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) (Static Code Analysis)
  - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) (Vulnerability Scanning)
  - [Dependency Review](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies)
- **Containerization** with Docker
- **Secure Deployment** (to GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub)

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

The **GitHub Actions workflow** (`ci-cd.yml`) runs on **push and pull request** events.  
It includes the following stages:

1. **Checkout Code**
   - Fetches the source code from the repository.

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Configures Python and installs dependencies.

3. **Code Linting**
   - Runs `flake8` to enforce Python code quality standards.

4. **Unit Testing**
   - Executes tests with `pytest` to ensure functionality.

5. **Dependency Review**
   - Checks for vulnerable third-party libraries.

6. **CodeQL Analysis**
   - Scans for security issues in the source code.

7. **Docker Build & Scan**
   - Builds a Docker image for the app.
   - Uses **Trivy** to scan the image for vulnerabilities.

8. **Deployment**
   - Pushes the Docker image to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork/Clone This Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/devsecops-project.git
cd devsecops-project
````

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to **GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions** and add:

* `CR_PAT` → GitHub Personal Access Token (with `write:packages` permission)

### 3. Install Dependencies Locally (optional)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

### 4. Push Code

Once you push changes, the **GitHub Actions pipeline** will automatically run.

---

## 📦 Docker Instructions (Local)

### Build Image

```bash
docker build -t devsecops-app .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 devsecops-app
```

### Test Locally

Visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🔒 Security Tools in Action

* **CodeQL** → Scans code for common vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Review** → Alerts on vulnerable libraries.
* **Trivy** → Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.

---

## ✅ Example Workflow Run

When you push code:

1. GitHub Actions triggers `ci-cd.yml`.
2. Runs linting, tests, and scans.
3. Builds and scans Docker image.
4. Deploys to **GitHub Container Registry**.

You can monitor workflow runs under **Actions Tab** in your repo.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* Add **SAST/DAST** integrations
* Deploy to **Kubernetes** or **AWS/GCP/Azure**
* Implement **Slack/MS Teams notifications**
* Add **IaC Security Scanning** (e.g., Terraform with Checkov)

Would you like me to also **generate the actual `ci-cd.yml` file content** (GitHub Actions workflow) so that your repo is fully ready-to-run, or keep the README general?
